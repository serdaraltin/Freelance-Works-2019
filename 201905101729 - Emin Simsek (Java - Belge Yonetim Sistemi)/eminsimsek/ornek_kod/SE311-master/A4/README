Simple Calculator

client/: holds all client files
server/: holds all server files
UML: UML.jpg
UML Component: UMLComponent.jpg

Two directories are seperate projects. Both have main files to run:
client/src/: MainCalc.java
server/src/: Server.java

Run the server first, running on localhost:8080, then run the MainCalc
should have no issues from there.

If you test for trying to create an error-ed operation and get ERR just have to 'C' clear it to get back to working again.

Sample Server Output:
Total Number of Successful Math Equations: 1
 55 + 3 = 58
Total Number of Successful Math Equations: 2
 55 + 3 = 58
 65 * 2 = 130
Total Number of Successful Math Equations: 3
 55 + 3 = 58
 65 * 2 = 130
 9 + 3 - 2 * 5 = 50
Total Number of Successful Math Equations: 4
 55 + 3 = 58
 65 * 2 = 130
 9 + 3 - 2 * 5 = 50
 88 + 12 / 10 * 4 = 40
`
Tested operations to make sure keep track and same time update view.
Server keeps track of total operations and stores and prints the math expressions.
