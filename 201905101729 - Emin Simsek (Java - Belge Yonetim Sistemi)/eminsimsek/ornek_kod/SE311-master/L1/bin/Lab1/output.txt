CRYPTOGRAM DECODED

CARES PULL MY SPIRITS DOWN
ALWAYS FORCE ME, �WEAR A FROWN�
I HEARD, �YOU�LL IN DARKNESS DROWN;
FOR WEEDS IN YOU ARE ALSO SOWN.�

SEEDS LIKE UNKNOWN FEAR AND WORRY
SPROUTED IN MY NURSERY BED OF MERRY
ON WATERING, I NOURISHED MISERY
UNABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR FINERY

GRADUALLY GREW SEEDS CALLED HEALTH AND WEALTH 
BUT SORROW AND SUFFERINGS SAPPED ITS STRENGTH
I BATTLED AND STRUGGLED TO SAVE MY BREATH
EXPECTING SOMEONE TO FILL MY HEART WITH MIRTH

WITH THIS FRAME OF MIND
NO WAY OF ESCAPE I COULD FIND
ON REACHING OFFICE, I READ THIS THOUGHT
RECITED IT SEVERAL TIMES IN MY HEART

THAT EVERY SAD DAY
IS FOLLOWED BY A GLAD DAY
AS A TEAM WE DISCUSSED THE LAYOUT
OF A VERY IMPORTANT HANDOUT

GREEN IS GOOD AND SOOTHES THE EYE
YELLOW AND BLACK NEVER GET AN INSTANT GOODBYE
RED AND NAVY BLUE GIVE A PROFESSIONAL LOOK
LAVENDER OR SKY BLUE, GETS ANYONE ON HOOK

EVERYONE SUGGESTED A HUE
AND IT GRANTED ME A CUE
OF GREAT SURPRISE AMONG A FEW
THAT IF COLORS CARRIED A CLUE

OF A TOP SECRET MESSAGE 
THEN I REMEMBERED A PASSAGE
FOR THIS WORLD JESUS IS THE TRUE LIGHT
WHO MAKES THE FACE OF ANY MAN BRIGHT

HE�LL WEED AND MAKE ME ALRIGHT
MY LIFE LIKE AROMA WILL ASCEND IN HIS SIGHT
IF EACH AND EVERY SHADE
THAT ALMIGHTY HAS MADE

REFLECTS GOD, AS A MIGHTY TOWER
AND ALSO EXPOUNDS HIS AWESOME POWER
UNIQUE HIS WAY OF HAVING SEEN MY FORM
BEING FORMED IN WOMB LIKE A WORM

FEARFUL YET SURPRISE FILLED IS HIS GREATNESS
I WONDER AND MOVE ABOUT CARRYING HIS LIKENESS
